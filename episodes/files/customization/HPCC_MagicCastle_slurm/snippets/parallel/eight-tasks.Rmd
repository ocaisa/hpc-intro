```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` nano parallel-job.sh
`r config$remote$prompt` cat parallel-job.sh
```

```bash
`r config$remote$shebang`
`r config$sched$comment` `r config$sched$flag$name` parallel-job
`r config$sched$comment` `r config$sched$flag$queue` `r config$sched$queue$testing`
`r config$sched$comment` -N 1
`r config$sched$comment` -n 8

# Load the computing environment we need
# (mpi4py and numpy are in SciPy-bundle)
module load `r config$remote$modules$python`
module load SciPy-bundle

# Execute the task
mpiexec amdahl
```

Then submit your job. Note that the submission command has not really changed
from how we submitted the serial job: all the parallel settings are in the
batch file rather than the command line.

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` `r config$sched$submit$name` parallel-job.sh
```

As before, use the status commands to check when your job runs.

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` ls -t
```

```output
slurm-347271.out  parallel-job.sh  slurm-347178.out  slurm-347087.out  serial-job.sh  amdahl  README.md  LICENSE.txt
```

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` cat slurm-347178.out
```
