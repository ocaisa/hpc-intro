## Job environment variables

When ``r config$sched$name`` runs a job, it sets a number of environment
variables for the job. One of these will let us check what directory our job
script was submitted from. The `SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` variable is set to the
directory from which our job was submitted. Using the `SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`
variable, modify your job so that it prints out the location from which the
job was submitted.

## Solution

```bash
`r config$remote$prompt` nano example-job.sh
`r config$remote$prompt` cat example-job.sh
```

```bash
`r config$remote$bash_shebang`
`r config$sched$comment` -t 00:00:30

echo -n "This script is running on "
hostname

echo "This job was launched in the following directory:"
echo ${SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR}
```
