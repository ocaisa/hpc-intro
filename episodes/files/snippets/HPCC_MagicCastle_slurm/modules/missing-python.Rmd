If the `python3` command was unavailable, we would see output like

```output
/usr/bin/which: no python3 in (/cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12/compat/linux/x86_64/usr/bin:/opt/software/slurm/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin:/home/`r config$remote$user`/.local/bin:/home/`r config$remote$user`/bin)
```

Note that this wall of text is really a list, with values separated
by the `:` character. The output is telling us that the `which` command
searched the following directories for `python3`, without success:

```output
/cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12/compat/linux/x86_64/usr/bin
/opt/software/slurm/bin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/sbin
/opt/puppetlabs/bin
/home/`r config$remote$user`/.local/bin
/home/`r config$remote$user`/bin
```

However, in our case we do have an existing `python3` available so we see

```output
/cvmfs/pilot.eessi-hpc.org/2020.12/compat/linux/x86_64/usr/bin/python3
```

We need a different Python than the system provided one though, so let us load
a module to access it.
