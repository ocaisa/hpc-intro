# CONFIGURING FOR YOUR SYSTEM

# For this lesson we use a default configuration which should have all
# configuration and snippet items referenced in the lesson.
# (snippets are in a subdirectory alongside the configuraton file)
default_config: episodes/files/customization/HPCC_MagicCastle_slurm/_config_options.yml

# Optionally, you can then override this default with (a subset of) customized
# values that more closely match your system
# (custom snippets should be in a subdirectory alongside the configuraton file, you can
# also override none or as many of those as you like)

# You could use the configuration option below but, rather than edit this file,
# the build system listens to the environment variable
# "HPC_CARPENTRY_CUSTOMIZATION" which you set to the path to your customisations

# custom_config: episodes/files/customization/Ghastly_Mistakes/_config_options.yml
